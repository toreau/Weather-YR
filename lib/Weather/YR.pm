=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Weather::YR;
    use DateTime::TimeZone;
    use LWP::UserAgent;
    use feature 'say';

    my $yr = Weather::YR->new(
        lang => 'en',
        lat  => 63.5908,
        lon  => 10.7414,
        tz   => DateTime::TimeZone->new( name => 'Europe/Oslo' ),
        ua   => LWP::UserAgent->new(
            agent => 'AcmeWeatherApp/0.9 support@example.com',
        ),
    );

    foreach my $day ( @{$yr->location_forecast->days} ) {
        say 'Weather data for ' . $day->date->ymd . ':';
        say ' ' x 4 . 'Temperature @ ' . $day->temperature->from->hms . ': ' . $day->temperature->celsius;

        foreach my $dp ( @{$day->datapoints} ) {
            say ' ' x 4 . 'Wind direction @ ' . $dp->wind_direction->from->hms . ': ' . $dp->wind_direction->name;
        }
    }

    # If you are interested in the weather right now (*):

    my $now = $yr->location_forecast->now;

    say "It's " . $now->temperature->celsius . "C outside.";
    say "Weather status: " . $now->precipitation->symbol->text;

    # (*) "Right now" is actually lying, as the data from Yr is always
    #     a _forecast_, ie. what the weather will be like. The now()
    #     method simply picks the closest data point in time.
